### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

ERD work was completed using FigJam. The data models use both embedding and referencing. ```Cart``` model utilizes subschema for items in the cart (item id and quantity). All three models reference each other.

### JS model files

* model-user.js

Defines mongoose model for User â€“ both grocers and shoppers. User chooses the type of account upon signing up. Shopper users store an array of objects within the ```pastOrders``` variable, and this object is defined in the ```orderSchema``` subschema. The ```items``` variable within the ```orderSchema``` store an array of obejcts from the previously checked out cart. **It is ultimately an array of objects within an object that is within an array of objects.**

* model-grocery.js

Defines mongoose model for Grocery item, and can be added only by Grocers. Each Grocery item can be archived by switching the ```listed``` value to false. The ```image``` key retrieves the image from the url from the web. The ```seller``` key points to the ```User``` model's id. 

* model-cart.js

Defines mongoose model for Cart item, and it is created for every shopper when they sign up. It is a one-to-one relationship. Cart model has an embedded subschema ```cartItemSchema``` that references the id of the ```Grocery``` and specifies the quantity in cart. ```Cart.items``` is an array of objects that originate from such subchema. Cart gets cleared every time a transaction happens. 


## Future improvements

* ### Combining User and Grocer Into One User

It would be an important next step â€“ give dual functionality to a single account, so grocers can have carts and shop, while shoppers can also create listings and sell. Routes would need to change, and it might become confusing.

* ### Restocking Items Automatically

The grocer specifies whether the item is restocked in the following ```Grocery``` model's excerpt. 

``` js
quantity: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
        default: 1
    },
resupplied: {
        type: Boolean,
        required: true,
    },
frequency: Number,
```

It would be a great next step to create a timer mechanism where if the ```quantity``` is equal to 0, the timer sets off and automatically replenishes the stock once it reaches the ```frequency``` value.

* ### Drag and Drop Image for Listing

At this point, the grocers have to add publicly available images via links. It would be great to add a drag-and-drop feature for images added locally and uploaded to the server.

* ### Cleaner Code

The code has redundant functions and routes that could be optimized.

* ### Arrays of Objects in Array of Objects Complexity

As the database grows, the time to retrieve data would get longer and longer as the Big O of nested loops present in the project isof quadratic complexity (if not cubic...). The models reference each  other and create a lot of arrays of objects within arrays of objects (especially for past orders), and it becomes complicated to retrieve data. Maybe creating another data model would help with that instead of embedding within embedding.
